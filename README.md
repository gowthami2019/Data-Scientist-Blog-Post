### Stack Overflow Data-2017 survey

### Project Overview
- Every year, Stack Overflow conducts a massive survey of people on the site, covering all sorts of information like programming languages, salary, code style, and various other information. This year, they amassed more than 64,000 responses fielded from 213 countries.

### Business Understanding
- Which location has the highest salary?
- Which location has the highest salary growth?
- which location has the highest career satisfaction?

### Installations
- Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn

### Data Analysis
- For the data preparation phase, we gathered the data, assessed it and then proceeded to clean it, focusing on our columns of interest, with python libraries of Numpy and Pandas

### Result
- I have analyzed correlation between various parameters by (salary Vs location),(Years of experience Vs Career Satisfaction),(Years of experience Vs Salary Growth Rate).
